# GitHub Explorer
This is an app that uses GitHub's API, lets you search for repositories available on the site. It also stores them in a local cache in your browser and lets you see its issues, stars and forks.

## Home Page:

## Dashboard:

The app is being built using ReactJS and Typescript.

To start using the app while in development, you must download the repository, open it in your preffered IDE,
type 'yarn' on the console to install the dependencies, and last but not least, type 'yarn start' on the console to launch the app in a local server on your machine.

After you've started the app on your machine, you can search for any public repository from GitHub by simply typing the name of the profile followed by a dash and the name of the repository (example: profile/repository).
